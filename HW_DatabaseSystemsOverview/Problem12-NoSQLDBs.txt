A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that uses looser consistency models 
rather than traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are often highly optimized key–value stores intended
for simple retrieval and appending operations, with the goal being significant performance benefits 
in terms of latency and throughput.
