Transactions are used for ensuring that a sequence of database operations will be 
executed as a single unit – they will all be executed successfully or none of them will be executed.
An example for transaction usage is the scenario when two people using the same account want to buy
a stock from an internet store at the same time – one of them will succeed but the second one
will be pleased to try again later because the database will lock the amount of money in the account.
